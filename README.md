# Welcome to Vote with Sense Social Experiment!

-  We want to develop a mobile web app that offers users show their support for the 
Peter Obi & Labour Party candidacy leading up to the general elections in 2027.
 
 - The webApp will only be accessible via mobile/tablet browsers. Users accessing via 
other devices will see a page directing them to access via mobile device. The 
project is the first of a series of social experiments designed to engage the voting 
populace with targeted activities to drive trends on social media and enforce a 
narrative
